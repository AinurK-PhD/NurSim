# 🛢️ NurSim – 2D Reservoir Simulation App

**NurSim** is an interactive, browser-based reservoir simulator for 2D single-phase flow, built using Python and Streamlit. It is designed for educational and research purposes, focusing on field-unit input, finite difference methods, and customizable well placement.
